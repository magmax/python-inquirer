# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving this project.
This project is open-source under the [MIT license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

- [Source Code]
- [Documentation]
- [Issue Tracker]
- [Code of Conduct]

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker].

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.7+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install the package with development requirements:

```sh
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```sh
$ poetry run python
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```sh
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```sh
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```sh
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```sh
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
